# I Wanna Lockpick Editor
This is an editor to make and play [I Wanna Lockpick](https://lawatson.itch.io/i-wanna-lockpick) levels. It includes most of the game's mechanics, but is still being worked on to include the rest, fix bugs, improve UX, and maybe add new mechanics too.

It's made in the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/).

## Download
You can download the editor at https://l4vo5.itch.io/i-wanna-lockpick-editor, which is also the main page for the editor. You can also try to use it in your browser on the same link, but it's not recommended as it can have poor performance and extra bugs. And I'm currently not even sure how to save or load levels in the web version.

## Opening in Godot
You can open the project by using Godot version **4.2.2** (or a compatible one). If you're not happy just sharing levels, feel free to modify the project into your own fangame and release it.

## License
The LICENSE.txt file applies to all the source code, except for addons with their own license. It doesn't apply to any assets, as the majority aren't mine. They probably come from I Wanna Lockpick, [I Wanna Keypick 100](http://ibbs.info/thread.php?id=iwanna&no=565), or some other source. In other words, I don't know their copyright status.

The only reason I'm including a license in the first place is because you're "supposed" to do it for your open source projects. I'm not about to go on some sort of mission to make sure all asset usage is correct copyright-wise, in what's essentially a fangame of a fangame of a fangame of a game, with each step of the way liberally taking assets from many other copyrighted sources.
